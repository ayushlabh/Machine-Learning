3. Pytorch





Top Neural Networks :

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Selecting filters of some size (eg 3x3) and convolving(sliding) different filters over the image individualy to get a
									    stack of filtered images. Convolution layer is then followed by ReLU layer and pooling layer .

2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - It is used for continues input , sequence recognisation and forecasting. One of the inputs fed to the layer of RNN is its 
								    output only .It also used memory like LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)

3. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) - 2 layers visible(input) and hidden layer.First random weights and biases are assigned.Then backpropogated from hidded
                                        to visible layer to calculate the difference and hence wights and bias are calculated.Probabilistic approach is used.   

4. Deep Belied Nets (DBN) - It has a structure similar to Multilayer perceptron(MLP) network and works as many RBMs are stacked over one other and hidden layer 
                            of first works as visible layer of second RBM .

5. Autoencoders

6. Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) -
